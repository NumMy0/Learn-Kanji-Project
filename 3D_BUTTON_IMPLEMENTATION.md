## Special Features

### Disabled State

- Shadow disappears completely
- Immediate visual feedback

## Files Modified

### 1. src/style.css
- Replaced invalid `@theme` with proper `:root` CSS custom properties
- Added comprehensive 3D button system with 6 variants
- Includes disabled states and proper transitions

### 2. src/views/WelcomePage.vue
- **Simplified JLPT level selection cards** to work better as 3D buttons
- **Removed complex nested divs** and gradients for cleaner button structure
- **Applied level-specific 3D button classes** (btn-3d-jlpt5, btn-3d-jlpt4, etc.)
- **Each level has unique green color scheme** for better visual distinction
- **Updated secondary action buttons** to use green variants (btn-3d-green-light, btn-3d-green-medium)
- **Updated info section indicators** to use green color palette
- Fixed incomplete template structure
- Added third learning feature in the info section

### 3. src/components/KanjiCard.vue
- **Fixed button overlap issue** - repositioned buttons to avoid superposition
- Updated study mode toggle button to use `btn-3d-green-floating`
- Applied `btn-3d-green-primary` to validation button
- Applied `btn-3d-green-light` to reset button
- **Updated back button** to use `btn-3d-green-back` for consistency
- **Converted all colors to green palette**: progress bar, info sections, input focus, result feedback
- **Enhanced visual feedback** with green-themed success/error states
- **Study mode styling** updated to use green color scheme

## Color Integration
All button variants utilize the existing custom color palette, with the main JLPT buttons using a cohesive green theme:

### New Green Palette for JLPT Buttons:
- **Mindaro (#ECF39E)** - Lightest green for JLPT-5 (easiest level)
- **MossGreen (#90A955)** - Light green transitioning to medium
- **FernGreen (#4F772D)** - Medium green for intermediate levels
- **HunterGreen (#31572C)** - Dark green for advanced levels

- GrisTinta (#1E1E1E) - Dark text and shadows

## Implementation Benefits
- Consistent visual language across the entire application
- Enhanced user interaction feedback
- Maintains accessibility with proper contrast ratios
- Responsive to different button contexts (floating, card, main actions)
- Smooth animations that don't interfere with usability
- Proper disabled states for form validation

## Browser Compatibility
- Uses modern CSS features (transform3d, cubic-bezier)
- Fallback-friendly with graceful degradation
- Optimized for performance with hardware acceleration

The 3D button system is now fully integrated and provides a modern, cohesive user interface that enhances the Japanese learning experience while maintaining excellent usability and accessibility standards.
